READ ME:

Hope you will enjoy my work.
I use Python 3.8 and worked with PyCharm Community Edition 2020.1 x64.
First I chose testImg1.jpg because its a placement of my uncle and it was very dark image. So with the help of hsitogramEqualize
function, the image looks better and now we can post it on Yad2.
Second, I chose testImg2.jpg because it was nice picture but a little bit dark and not balanced.

My functions:
imReadAndConvert: Reads an image, and returns the image converted as requested
imDisplay: Reads an image as RGB or GRAY_SCALE and displays it
transformRGB2YIQ: Converts an RGB image to YIQ color space
transformYIQ2RGB: Converts an YIQ image to RGB color space
histogramEqualize: Equalizes the histogram of an image
quantizeImage: Quantized an image in to nQuant colors
gammaDisplay: GUI for gamma correction and calculate
